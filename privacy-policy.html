                        <p class="">This Privacy Policy governs the use of all products and services (collectively, the
                            "Services") offered by ThinkSmart Software Pty Ltd, and their affiliates and subsidiaries to
                            its customers ("Customer"). ThinkSmart Software may modify this Policy at any time without
                            notice, whereby the current version will be available on our ThinkSmart website at all
                            times. This web site is owned and operated by ThinkSmart Software Pty Ltd and will be
                            referred to as "We", "our" and "us" in this Internet Privacy Policy. By using this site, you
                            agree to the Internet Privacy Policy of this web site ("the web site"), which is set out on
                            this web site page. The Internet Privacy Policy relates to the collection and use of
                            personal information you may supply to us through your conduct on the web site.</p>
                        <h4 class="">Policy</h5>
                        <p class="">We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify or remove portions of this Internet
                            Privacy Policy at any time. This Internet Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms
                            and conditions applicable to the web site. We recognise the importance of protecting the
                            privacy of information collected about visitors to our web sites, in particular information
                            that is capable of identifying an individual ("personal information"). This Internet Privacy
                            Policy governs the manner in which your personal information, obtained through the web site,
                            will be dealt with. This Internet Privacy Policy should be reviewed periodically so that you
                            are updated on any changes. We welcome your comments and feedback.</p>
                        <h4 class="">Personal Information</h5>
                        <p class="">1.Personal information about visitors to our site is collected only when knowingly and
                            voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you
                            with further services or to answer or forward any requests or enquiries. It is our intention
                            that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way
                            that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.</p>
                        <h4 class="">Use of Information</h5>
                        <p class="">2. Personal information that visitors submit to our site is used only for the purpose for
                            which it is submitted or for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary
                            purpose, unless we disclose other uses in this Internet Privacy Policy or at the time of
                            collection. Copies of correspondence sent from the web site, that may contain personal
                            information, are stored as archives for record-keeping and back-up purposes only.</p>
                        <h4 class="">Collecting Information</h5>
                        <p class="">3. As part of registering with us, we collect personal information about you in order for you
                            to take full advantage of our services. To do this it may be necessary for you to provide
                            additional information to us as detailed below.</p>
                        <h4 class="">Registration and Trials</h5>
                        <p class="">4. Registration and trials are completely optional. Registration and trials may include
                            submitting your name, company, email address, address, telephone numbers and other
                            information. You may access this information at any time by logging in and going to your
                            account.</p>
                        <h4 class="">Cookies and Related Technologies</h5>
                        <p class="">5. This website platform uses cookies, tracking pixels and related technologies to provide
                            our services for marketing purposes. Cookies are small data files that are served by our
                            platform and stored on your device. They enable us to identify your device when you move
                            between different websites and applications, so that we can serve targeted advertising to
                            our potential customers.</p>
                        <p class="">Specifically, the AdRoll cookie we serve through the AdRoll platform for this purpose is
                            named “__adroll”.</p>
                        <h4 class="">Credit Card and Banking Details</h5>
                        <p class="">6. Credit Card and bank details are only stored for the purpose of processing payment.</p>
                        <h4 class="">Disclosure</h5>
                        <p class="">7. Apart from where you have consented or disclosure is necessary to achieve the purpose for
                            which it was submitted, personal information may be disclosed in special situations where we
                            have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
                            against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with
                            our rights or property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Also,
                            we may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires
                            disclosure.<br>8. We may engage third parties to provide you with goods or services on our
                            behalf. In that circumstance, we may disclose your personal information to those third
